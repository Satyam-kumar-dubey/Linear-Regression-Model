# Linear-Regression-Model
## Project Overview

This project represents my first step into Machine Learning, where I built and tested a Linear Regression model to understand how input variables can be used to predict outcomes. The model achieved an accuracy of 83%, marking a strong starting point for deeper explorations into supervised learning algorithms.

## Objectives

1.Understand the fundamentals of regression analysis

2.Implement Linear Regression using Python (Scikit-learn / NumPy / Pandas)

3.Visualize data and regression performance

4.Evaluate model accuracy and learn from the results

## Dataset

1.Dataset Source: ( Kaggle )

2.Features Used: (model', 'year', 'price', 'transmission', 'mileage', 'fuelType', 'tax',
       'mpg', 'engineSize')

3.Target Variable: ('price')

## Model Description

The model was implemented using the Linear Regression algorithm from sklearn.linear_model.
Steps followed:

1.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

2.Splitting data into training and testing sets

3.Model training and fitting

4.Performance evaluation using R² Score and Adjusted R²


## Tech Stack

1.Language: Python

2.3Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

3.Tools: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Results

1.Model Accuracy: 83%

2.Evaluation Metric: R² Score and Adjusted R²

Observation: The model successfully captured the trend in data, with potential for improvement using feature scaling and advanced regression techniques.

## Learnings

1.2How linear regression maps input features to output predictions

2.Importance of data preprocessing

3.Basics of train-test splits and model evaluation metrics

How to visualize relationships between variables

## Future Improvements

1.Implement Polynomial Regression or Ridge/Lasso Regression

2.Explore feature engineering for better accuracy

3.Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask
