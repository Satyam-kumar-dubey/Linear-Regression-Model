# Linear-Regression-Model
This project represents my first step into Machine Learning, where I built and tested a Linear Regression model to understand how input variables can be used to predict outcomes. The model achieved an accuracy of 83%, marking a strong starting point for deeper explorations into supervised learning algorithms
